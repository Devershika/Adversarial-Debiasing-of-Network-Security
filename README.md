Research Project Adversarial Debiasing of Machine Learning Models for Enhanced Network Security against DDoS Attacks under Symbiosis Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remain a critical challenge in network security, disrupting services by overwhelming systems with malicious traffic. Traditional firewalls, though effective against conventional threats, are increasingly inadequate against sophisticated attack patterns amplified by Generative AI. This study proposes an enhanced detection framework that leverages a Random Forest classifier trained on synthetic data generated through a GAN architecture. The generated data demonstrated an 80.3% similarity to real network traffic, providing a strong foundation for model robustness. To improve classification accuracy and reduce bias, adversarial debiasing techniques were incorporated, focusing on sensitive attributes such as the number of forward and backward packets, as well as their total lengths. This approach mitigates bias and strengthens the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic. Retraining with a combination of synthetic and real data significantly enhanced detection performance. On benchmark datasets, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.98%, while inference on previously unseen synthetic datasets yielded a +22.60% improvement over traditional benchmark models. These results establish a strong baseline for building adaptable DDoS detection systems capable of withstanding adversarial attacks and addressing the evolving landscape of cyber threats.
